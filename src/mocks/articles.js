    title: "EXCESSIVE SCREEN TIME IS KILLING CHILDREN'S IMAGINATIONS, SAY NURSERY WORKERS",
    article: `Excessive screen time is negatively impacting on children’s imaginations, nursery workers have said.

    Today’s children spend more time gazing at screens than ever, with smartphones and tablets competing with the television for their attention.
    
    But while some argue that technology can support child development, industry experts suggest that too much screen time could in fact result in a loss of imagination.
    
    According to a poll of 1,000 nursery workers, conducted by review website daynurseries.co.uk, almost two-thirds of childcare professionals believe that screens are making children less creative. 
    
    The survey found that fewer than half (48 per cent) of nursery workers said there are children at their nursery with imaginary friends.`,

    article: `Parents should avoid giving rice to young children, scientists have said, after a new study found almost three quarters of rice-based products sold as baby food contain illegal levels of arsenic.

    A maximum level of arsenic allowed in rice used for baby food was introduced by the EU in January 2016 to reduce children’s exposure to the harmful toxin.

    article: `With the launch of a dedicated Apple Developer mobile app, Apple is introducing a new resource for more than 23 million registered members of its developer community. The app is an expansion of its existing WWDC app for Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference, which it will supersede.

    As reported by TechCrunch, the app will include relevant resources – like technical and design articles, developer news and updates, videos and more – instead of just including information about the developer event itself. It will also offer a technique for developers to enrol in the Apple Developer program and maintain their membership.
    
    While the app may not have everything people could otherwise find on Apple’s Developer website right now, its offerings will grow over time.
    
    The launch of the app comes at a time when Apple has been focused on growing its international community of developers via investments in local developer academies and accelerators – efforts that have been paying off.
    
    The app is available on iOS, including Apple Watch and iMessage.
    
    In September, as this publication reported, Apple said it was giving iOS developers whose apps use HTML5 containers and deal with real cash, six months longer to make them fully-native. Affected apps now have until 3 March, 2020 to become compliant with Apple’s new policies, or risk being pulled from the App Store.
    
    In the same month, an analysis showed Apple’s use of Swift has doubled in iOS 13 as it further distances itself from Objective-C. While adoption of Swift by third-party developers is high, much of Apple’s operating system still uses Objective-C.`,

    article: `Google has released a new Android Automotive emulator which provides a full replica of the OS to help developers test their apps.

    While Android Auto essentially mirrors apps running from a connected Android device, Android Automotive is a full operating system designed for the car.
    
    The tighter integration Android Automotive has with the vehicle opens new opportunities for developers, but it also makes robust testing in an emulator prior to real-world trials even more critical.
    
    Google’s updated Android Automotive OS emulator now includes the Play Store which provides a complete solution for developers to design, create, and test their apps, even if they don’t have access to a supported vehicle.
    
    Porting apps from Android Auto to Android Automotive is a relatively trivial process which many developers have already undertaken. Google says more apps like Amazon Music, YouTube Music, and Audioburst will make the transition soon.
    
    Google plans to provide further details about creating apps for Android Automotive at the Android Dev Summit 2019 which runs from today (October 23rd) until tomorrow.
    
    Android Dev Summit 2019 is being streamed live and more information, including a schedule, can be found here.`,

    title: "Apple Arcade follows industry shift to gaming subscriptions",
    article: `Apple Arcade is Cupertino’s jab at following the industry shift into providing unlimited access to games through a subscription model.

    Gaming is among the last of the core entertainment industries to switch to such a model. Music is now primarily accessed through services like Spotify and Apple Music, while video is served by companies such as Netflix and Hulu. Even books are heading in that direction with services Like Kindle Unlimited.
    
    Apple is the first platform-holder to debut the model on mobile. In the console realm, Xbox Game Pass has been an incredible success and even includes games on release from all of Microsoft's growing roster of first-party studios.
    
    The success of Xbox Game Pass is likely the reason behind Microsoft's recent flurry of first-party studio acquisitions. In years prior, the company had to make difficult decisions to axe beloved studios.
    
    It's understandable that Apple has witnessed the success of services like Game Pass and EA Access, and plans to replicate it on mobile.
    
    The biggest advantage is that money can be allocated to support the visions of smaller game developers that may never have otherwise been realised. Free access also ensures more gamers can experience that vision who may never have, and it doesn't have to be affected by unsightly monetisation tactics.
    
    As for mobile gaming in general, it's expected to continue booming. According to a report from ResearchAndMarkets, the market will grow at a CAGR of 21.35% to reach $205.460 billion by 2023.
    
    Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is just as bullish about mobile gaming's potential.
    
    “Platform decisions are overrated," said Sweeney in an interview with Business Insider. "It's what we see on 'Fortnite,' so many of these gamers play on a variety of devices, so you can't say they're a mobile gamer or a console gamer. They're just a gamer.”
    
    With game streaming technology coming of age, through services like Google Stadia and Microsoft xCloud, that line between mobile and console/PC gamer is blurring even further. A subscription combined with streaming would provide instant access to games without dealing with individual payments, ads, and long downloads.
    
    Of course, the subscription model requires good management on Apple's part to allocate resources and ensure some developers are not losing out in favour of others. Only time will tell if that's the case, but it's clear that game subscriptions are the way the industry is heading.
    
    Apple Arcade will launch this fall with over 100 exclusive games. It will be available in 150+ countries.`,

    title: "Analysis of the average JavaScript developer and their favourite tools",
    article: `A new analysis based on data from StackOverflow has shed light on the average JavaScript developer and their favourite tools and technologies.

    JavaScript remains the world's most popular programming language despite many others nipping at its heels.
    
    90,000 developers took this year's StackOverflow survey, making it still among the most comprehensive insights of the development community.
    
    The majority of those who describe themselves as primarily JavaScript developers say they are 'full stack' devs working on both front-end technologies such as apps on web or native platforms, and back-end technologies running on servers.
    
    Somewhat surprisingly, given JavaScript's original design as a web scripting language, a greater number of developers are back-end. This is perhaps due to Node.js' growing popularity as a server-side runtime for JavaScript.
    
    A large number of JavaScript frameworks have increased the language's versatility. React Native, for example, allows JavaScript to be used for mobile app development. Electron is an equivalent JavaScript framework enabling desktop app development.
    
    This versatility is presenting itself in the many roles of JavaScript developers. Desktop/enterprise app developer is the most common role for JavaScript devs, followed by mobile app developer, student, and device administrator to round-out the top four.
    
    In terms of frameworks, JQuery remains the most popular by some distance. JQuery was predominantly used to fix issues with JavaScript that have since been addressed, so it's perhaps another surprise to see it maintain such a lead.
    
    The following three most popular frameworks are less surprising. Second place goes to React Native, unsurprising given its use for mobile app development. Third place goes to Google's Angular, while fourth goes to server-side framework ASP.NET.

    Visual Studio Code is JavaScript developers' most popular tool, along with Visual Studio. The popularity of Microsoft's IDEs are unsurprising given the growing use of Microsoft's own TypeScript which both also support.
    
    IntelliJ Idea is the second most popular IDE – supporting JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Angular – but it's just pipped in overall popularity by code editor Notepad++.

    When it comes to databases, MySQL still rules the roost. PostgreSQL takes second place, Microsoft SQL Server in third, and SQLite in fourth. MongoDB, a document-based distributed database, just falls out of the top four.

    Most JavaScript developers are opting to develop on Linux, with Windows just behind. Container platform Docker, public cloud computing platform AWS, and Google's mobile OS Android take the following three places. MacOS is in fourth place.

    The results of the analysis of JavaScript developers and their favourite tools are mostly predictable, but there are certainly a couple of surprises in there. It's clear that JavaScript remains a popular and increasingly versatile language that shows little sign of slowing down.
