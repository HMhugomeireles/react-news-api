## CTW Frontend Interview Task

We do not expect this exercise to take more than 4 to 6 hours and will give you a
week to complete it, starting from the day you receive it.

The challenge is to build a web application which displays a list of articles. When the
user clicks on an article's item on the homepage, a page with details, like title, text &
media should open. The user should then be able to refresh the webpage and
maintain the selected article.

The user interface is up to you - we only require the page to be responsive and have
two different breakpoints - mobile, from 0px to 767px, and desktop, from 768px up.
We suggest doing a mobile-first approach.

You are free to use any frontend framework or library, including Angular, React,
VueJS, Svelte, jQuery, Ember, Knockout, Bootstrap - use whatever you are more
comfortable with.
You can use mock data for the articles, but if you feel at ease then use a mocking
server library.

After exercise completion, the code should be uploaded to a private git repository and
invite the emails that CTW's HR gave you. Please ensure that the code works on a
fresh install before sending it to us.
